# Things to do
- [ ] Write this README
- [ ] Output data to a file that can be used to make a graph or something (probably a csv file)

Test different scenarios:
 - [ ] Random things being accessed 
 - [ ] Few things being accessed a lot, a lot of things being accessed a bit
 - [ ] Different number of acesses to see if some strategies do better under load, per se
